Welcome to django-getpaid's documentation!
==========================================

**django-getpaid** is a multi-broker payment processor for Django. Main features include:

* support for multiple payment brokers at the same time
* very flexible architecture
* support for asynchronous status updates - both push and pull
* support for modern REST-based broker APIs
* support for multiple currencies (but one per payment)
* support for global and per-plugin validators
* easy customization with provided base abstract models and swappable mechanic (same as with Django's User model)

We would like to provide a :doc:`catalog<catalog>` of plugins for ``django-getpaid`` - if you create a plugin please let us know.

**Disclaimer:** this project has nothing in common with `getpaid <http://code.google.com/p/getpaid/>`_ plone project.
